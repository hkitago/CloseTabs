This Safari extension makes it easy to manage and close multiple tabs from the same website. Instead of manually closing each tab one by one, you can quickly identify all tabs belonging to a site and close them with a single action.  

The extension works seamlessly in the Safari toolbar and popover, providing an intuitive interface that allows you to:  
- Filter tabs by website domain  
- Preview tabs before closing  
- Customize filter options in the settings  

By streamlining tab management, this extension helps keep your browsing organized, reduces clutter, and improves overall productivity.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Load some web pages.
2. Tap the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension.
3. A window will slide up from the bottom on iPhone, or a pop-up window will appear on iPad and Mac; select an action and tap it.

> [!NOTE]  
> You need to proactively set **Safari > Settings > Tabs > Close Tabs** to a desired option.  
> Without this, the extension’s initial popover may appear behind other windows and become unresponsive.
